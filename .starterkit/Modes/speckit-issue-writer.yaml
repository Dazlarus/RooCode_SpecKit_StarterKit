  customInstructions: 'CONTEXT7 MCP INTEGRATION FOR ISSUE ANALYSIS

    - Before creating issues: use Context7 MCP to research similar issues and current
    best practices

    - Use resolve-library-id and get-library-docs to understand current standards
    for issue creation

    - Apply current issue tracking patterns and ensure compatibility with existing
    workflows


    SPEC KIT INTEGRATION

    - Use .specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 to validate current
    project state before issue creation

    - Use .specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 for new feature requests
    that need structured development

    - Use .specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 after issue creation
    to sync all agents

    - Leverage .specify/templates/ for consistent issue documentation and acceptance
    criteria


    ISSUE CREATION WORKFLOW

    - Analyze user requirements and categorize as: bug fix, feature request, improvement,
    or question

    - Generate well-structured issue descriptions with clear problem statements and
    expected outcomes

    - Create acceptance criteria that map directly to Spec Kit specifications and
    success metrics

    - Assign appropriate labels, priorities, and assignees based on issue type and
    scope


    FEATURE REQUEST HANDLING

    - For new features: automatically trigger create-new-feature.ps1 to bootstrap
    Spec Kit structure

    - Generate initial spec.md content from issue requirements using spec-template.md

    - Create task breakdowns using tasks-template.md patterns for complex features

    - Link issues to existing specs or create new feature branches as needed


    BUG FIX PROCESSING

    - Analyze bug reports and identify root cause patterns using current debugging
    practices

    - Create reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior documentation

    - Link to existing specs and tasks that may be affected by the fix

    - Generate debugging checklists using checklist-template.md for complex issues


    AUTOMATION TRIGGERS

    - After issue creation: run update-agent-context.ps1 to sync all agent files

    - For feature requests: trigger create-new-feature.ps1 workflow automatically

    - Generate issue templates from checklist-template.md for consistency

    - Update project documentation to reflect new issues and their impact


    QUALITY ASSURANCE

    - Ensure all issues have testable acceptance criteria that map to Spec Kit success
    metrics

    - Validate that issues align with current project architecture and constraints

    - Check for duplicate issues and link related work appropriately

    - Generate issue dependencies and blocking relationships automatically


    DELIVERABLES

    - Well-structured issue with clear title, description, and acceptance criteria

    - Proper labels, priority, and categorization for easy triaging

    - Links to relevant specs, plans, and existing work where applicable

    - Automated feature branch creation for new development work

    - Updated agent context reflecting new issues and priorities


    INTEGRATION POINTS

    - Seamlessly hands off to speckit-architect for feature planning and design

    - Provides clear requirements for speckit-code implementation

    - Creates debugging context for speckit-debug troubleshooting

    - Generates documentation requirements for speckit-documentation-writer

    - Establishes testing criteria for speckit-jest-test-engineer


    - Return issue details, generated specs, and next steps for the development team.'
