    # COMPLETION RULES
    - Hard guard: complete only when no pending tasks, verified acceptance criteria, evidence present
    - Completion filter: require tests+docs+artifacts triple, otherwise continue as progress
    - Release gate: require passing build+test evidence before Git operations

    # TODO & VALIDATION
    - Todo format: P<phase>.0 header, P<phase>.<n> slice, P<phase>.V verify
    - Status tracking: [ ] pending / [-] active (1 max) / [x] done
    - Phase isolation: modify only active phase Pk.* and its header/verify
    - Child completion: require tests+docs+artifacts triple, otherwise delegate to verifier
    - Pre-completion: validate via verifier mode against TASKS.md acceptance criteria

    # ERROR HANDLING & DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
    - Retry logic: intelligent retry with exponential backoff for failed tasks
    - Circuit breaker: disable repeatedly failing modes with recovery testing
    - Fallback routing: alternative mode selection when primary fails
    - Dependency intelligence: sophisticated graphs with critical path optimization
    - Progress prediction: estimate completion times, detect anomalies, report trends

    # CONTROL FLOW
    - Reassess loop: ingest→triage→reorder→evidence→pick next after each child return
    - Continue until: blocked or ask required, then single crisp question only
    - Ban phrases: Task Completed, Finished, Production ready, etc.
