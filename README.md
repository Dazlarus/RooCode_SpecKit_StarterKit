Roo Code + Spec Kit Development Team Package
===========================================

Overview
--------
This package provides a complete Roo Code + Spec Kit starter environment that can be dropped directly into any modern software project. It integrates Roo Code’s agentic workflow system with Spec Kit’s specification and task management tooling, enabling rapid, safe, and fully-documented development cycles.

Folder Structure
----------------
The root of this package is a `.roo` folder containing everything you need:

```
.roo/
 ├── commands/                	# Markdown command stubs for Roo/Spec Kit autodiscovery
 │    └── import-commands.md 	# Slash command to build/run a script to import custom_commands.yaml
 ├── custom_commands.yaml     	# Command bundle for Roo’s importer
 ├── dev_team.yaml            	# Roo mode definitions (Architect, Taskmaster, Verifier, etc.)
 ├── local-history/           	# Auto-generated snapshots (WRITE-GUARD)
 ├── scripts/                 	# Where scripts generated by my slash commands are supposed to go 
 │    └── import-commands.ps1	# The script Roo made to import the custom_commands.yaml
README.txt                     	# This guide
```

You can simply copy or extract this `.roo` folder into your project root, open VS Code, and begin using Roo Code immediately.

Requirements
-----------
**Before you begin, install:**
1. **VS Code** (latest version)
2. **Roo Code Extension** – Install from the VS Code Marketplace.
3. **Git** – Required for diffing, local version history, and guard commits.
4. **Spec Kit CLI** – Required for `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, and `/verify` commands.
   - Installation: Refer to [Spec Kit Documentation](https://docs.roocode.com) or use `npm install -g speckit` if available.
   - Verify with: `spec-kit --help`

VS Code Settings (for WRITE-GUARD & Local History)
-------------------------------------------------
Add the following to your **`.vscode/settings.json`** to enable granular recovery and align with the WRITE-GUARD system:
```json
{
  "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",
  "workbench.localHistory.enabled": true,
  "workbench.localHistory.maxFileSize": 10485760,
  "workbench.localHistory.maxFileEntries": 2048,
  "workbench.localHistory.saveDelay": 2
}
```
These settings ensure VS Code’s built-in Timeline and Roo’s WRITE-GUARD snapshots both capture file states before every major edit.

Installation Steps
------------------
1. **Drop the `.roo` folder into your project root.**
   - This folder contains all Roo and Spec Kit configuration files.
   - You may commit it to version control for shared environments.

2. **Import Modes**
   - Open Roo Code sidebar → **Modes → ⋮ → Import**.
   - Select `.roo/dev_team.yaml`.
   - Confirm that Architect 🏗️, Taskmaster 🧩, Verifier ✅, Repo Cleanup 🧹, and others appear in your mode list.

3. **Import Commands**
   - Run `/import-commands .roo/custom_commands.yaml --target .roo/commands`.
   - Reload VS Code (Command Palette → *Developer: Reload Window*).
   - Confirm that your commands appear under **Settings → Slash Commands → Workspace Commands**.

4. **Enable WRITE-GUARD (recommended)**
   - Run `/guard-on` to activate pre-write snapshots and diff protection.
   - Restores are available via `/rollback-file` and `/rollback-last`.

5. **Bootstrap Your First Spec Kit Project**
   - Switch to **🏗️ Architect** mode.
   - Describe your project and run `/bootstrap`.
   - This will create Constitution, Spec, Plan, and Tasks documents automatically.
   - Then switch to **🧩 Taskmaster** to begin implementing with `/implement` or `/implement-range`.

Usage Summary
-------------
### Common Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `/bootstrap` | Generate Constitution, Spec, Plan, and Tasks. |
| `/implement-range` | Execute a range of tasks concurrently (dependency-aware). |
| `/verify-task` | Validate task deliverables and acceptance criteria. |
| `/milestone` | Record progress checkpoints. |
| `/clarify-add` | Add clarifications to `SPEC.md`. |
| `/refactor-plan` | Safely plan structural refactors. |
| `/guard-on` / `/guard-off` | Toggle WRITE-GUARD snapshot system. |
| `/snapshot-now` / `/rollback-file` / `/rollback-last` | Manage workspace backups. |
| `/import-commands` / `/export-commands` | Sync commands between YAML and Markdown. |

### Core Modes
| Mode | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **🏗️ Architect** | Creates and updates foundational Spec Kit documents. |
| **🧩 Taskmaster (YOLO)** | Automates execution and task orchestration. |
| **✅ Verifier** | Confirms milestone completion and test coverage. |
| **🧹 Repo Cleanup** | Executes safe refactors with WRITE-GUARD enabled. |
| **💻 Code / 🐞 Debug** | Implements or repairs code while checking diffs. |
| **📝 Documentation Writer / 🔎 Research / 🧪 Test Engineer** | Handles doc, research, and test generation. |

Recommended Workflow
--------------------
1. **Bootstrap** → `/bootstrap` (creates Constitution, Spec, Plan, Tasks)
2. **Implement** → Taskmaster `/implement` (delegates subtasks safely)
3. **Document** → Docs auto-update as modes progress
4. **Refactor** → `/refactor-plan` then `/cleanup-batch`
5. **Verify** → `/verify-task` or `/milestone`

Advanced Features
-----------------
- **WRITE-GUARD:** Protects files from accidental deletion or truncation.
- **Snapshots:** All major changes backed up to `.roo/local-history/`.
- **Command Importer:** `/import-commands` rebuilds `.roo/commands/` automatically.
- **Spec Kit Integration:** Markdown stubs ensure full Spec Kit autodiscovery.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- **Commands not visible?** Run `/import-commands .roo/custom_commands.yaml --target .roo/commands` and reload VS Code.
- **Spec Kit CLI missing?** Install per Spec Kit docs and confirm via `spec-kit --help`.
- **Restore lost file:** Use `/rollback-file <path>` or `/rollback-last`.
- **WRITE-GUARD too strict?** Edit `.roo/guard.json` or disable temporarily with `/guard-off`.

Support & Customization
-----------------------
- To add new commands, edit `.roo/custom_commands.yaml` and re-run `/import-commands`.
- To modify behavior, update `.roo/dev_team.yaml` and re-import modes.
- Version control the `.roo/` folder to share setup across machines or teams.
