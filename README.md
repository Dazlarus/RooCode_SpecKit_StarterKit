## 💡 How It Works Together

### If You're New to Spec Kit (Roo Code User)

**Spec Kit** helps you structure your development process:

1. **📋 Specifications** - Write clear requirements that anyone can understand
2. **🏗️ Planning** - Create technical plans and architecture decisions
3. **✅ Tasks** - Break work into manageable, trackable pieces
4. **📚 Documentation** - Generate consistent docs automatically

**Roo Code** then uses these structured specs to:
- Generate code that matches your specifications exactly
- Debug issues with context from your plans
- Create documentation following your templates
- Validate work against your acceptance criteria

### If You're New to Roo Code (Spec Kit User)

**Roo Code** brings AI assistance to your structured development:

1. **🧠 Intelligent Code Generation** - Write code based on your specifications
2. **🔍 Smart Debugging** - Find and fix issues using your technical plans
3. **📝 Auto Documentation** - Generate docs from your templates
4. **⚡ Multiple Specializations** - Different AI modes for different tasks

**Spec Kit** provides the structure:
- Clear specifications for consistent requirements
- Technical planning for architecture decisions
- Task management for organized development
- Quality validation for reliable delivery

## 🎯 Your First Project

### Step 1: Set Up (Already Done!)
```bash
/starterkit-speckit-setup
