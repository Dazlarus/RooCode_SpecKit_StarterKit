## PowerShell Automation Scripts

The **Starter Kit** includes PowerShell scripts that help Roo Code work efficiently with Spec Kit:

### Essential Scripts
- **`check-prerequisites.ps1`** - Validates Spec Kit environment before starting
- **`create-new-feature.ps1`** - Sets up new features with Spec Kit structure
- **`setup-plan.ps1`** - Creates implementation plans and Spec Kit documentation
- **`update-agent-context.ps1`** - Keeps Roo Code modes synchronized with Spec Kit

### What These Scripts Provide
- **Environment validation** - Ensures Spec Kit is ready before development
- **Structured setup** - Creates consistent Spec Kit document organization
- **Context management** - Keeps all Roo Code modes working from current Spec Kit info
- **Activity logging** - Tracks all Spec Kit operations and changes

## Spec Kit Template System

**Spec Kit** uses structured templates to maintain consistency across your project documentation:

### Core Spec Kit Templates
- **`spec-template.md`** - Standard format for feature requirements and specifications
- **`plan-template.md`** - Technical planning and architecture documentation
- **`tasks-template.md`** - Task breakdown and phase organization
- **`checklist-template.md`** - Validation and review workflow checklists
- **`agent-file-template.md`** - Roo Code context file structure

### Template Capabilities
- **Dynamic content** - Templates automatically populate with current project information
- **Cross-linking** - Creates automatic connections between related Spec Kit documents
- **Consistent formatting** - Ensures all Spec Kit documentation follows the same structure
- **Incremental updates** - Only modifies sections that actually need changes

## Getting Started with Your Starter Kit 🎯

### 1. Choose Your Roo Code Configuration

Pick the configuration that matches your project size:

```yaml
# For small projects or learning Spec Kit
.roo/beginner-dev-team.yaml → custom-modes.yaml

# For solid development workflow with Spec Kit
.roo/foundation-dev-team.yaml → custom-modes.yaml

# For full development lifecycle with comprehensive Spec Kit
.roo/enterprise-dev-team.yaml → custom-modes.yaml
```

Import the YAML in **Roo Code** settings (look in the ... menu for modes section).

### 2. Initialize Your Spec Kit Project

Use the **Spec Kit** spec-init command to create structured project documentation:

```bash
# Tell Spec Kit what you want to build
specify init "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
```

### 3. Validate Your Setup

Run a quick validation to ensure everything works together:

```bash
# Make sure Spec Kit and Roo Code are working properly
specify validate
```

## How Roo Code Uses Spec Kit

**Roo Code** automatically uses the right mode based on your Spec Kit task:

- **"create a ticket"** or **"new requirement"** → Issue Writer (creates Spec Kit tasks)
- **"deploy"** or **"release"** → Release Manager (uses Spec Kit deployment plans)
- **"CI/CD"** or **"infrastructure"** → DevOps Engineer (follows Spec Kit infrastructure specs)
- **"performance"** or **"optimization"** → Performance Engineer (uses Spec Kit performance requirements)
- **"API"** or **"REST"** → API Designer (creates Spec Kit API specifications)
- **"design"** or **"architecture"** → Architect (creates Spec Kit technical plans)
- **"research"** or **"best practices"** → Research Updater (updates Spec Kit research docs)
- **"test"** or **"jest"** → Jest Test Engineer (creates Spec Kit test specifications)
- **"docs"** or **"readme"** → Documentation Writer (uses Spec Kit documentation templates)
- **"refactor"** or **"cleanup"** → Repository Cleanup (follows Spec Kit code standards)
- **"debug"** or **"fix"** → Debug (uses Spec Kit debugging workflows)
- **"implement"** or **"code"** → Code (follows Spec Kit implementation plans)

## Spec Kit Quality Standards

Every **Roo Code** mode working with **Spec Kit** follows strict completion criteria:

- **✅ Tests** - Must pass with evidence logs saved to Spec Kit runs/
- **📚 Documentation** - Complete and accurate using Spec Kit templates
- **📦 Artifacts** - Generated and validated according to Spec Kit specifications
- **🔄 Context** - Synchronized across all Roo Code modes using Spec Kit context

## Creating Custom Roo Code Modes

Want to create your own **Roo Code** modes for specific workflows? You can either:

1. **Manual method** - Edit your `custom-modes.yaml` file:

```yaml
customModes:
- slug: your-custom-mode
  name: Your Custom Mode
  description: What this mode does with Spec Kit
  roleDefinition: How it integrates with Spec Kit workflows
  customInstructions: |
    Your mode-specific instructions for Spec Kit integration
  groups:
  - read
  - edit
  source: global
```

2. **Easy method** - Use **Roo Code's Mode Writer** (available in the modes marketplace) to let AI help you create modes that work well with Spec Kit.

## Customizing Spec Kit Integration

You can customize the PowerShell scripts in `.specify/scripts/powershell/` to:

- Adjust Spec Kit prerequisite checks for your specific environment
- Add your own Spec Kit validation logic
- Extend Spec Kit context synchronization for your workflows
- Integrate Spec Kit with your existing development tools

## Troubleshooting Your Spec Kit Setup

Don't worry, here's how to fix common **Spec Kit + Roo Code** issues:

1. **Spec Kit context out of sync** - Run `specify update-context` to refresh all Roo Code modes
2. **Missing Spec Kit templates** - Make sure `.specify/templates/` has all the template files
3. **PowerShell script permissions** - Check that Spec Kit scripts can run on your system
4. **Spec Kit environment issues** - Run `specify validate` to diagnose project state

### Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Validate Spec Kit health
specify validate

# Sync Spec Kit context across Roo Code modes
specify update-context

# Check Spec Kit project status
specify status

# Verify Spec Kit prerequisites
specify check-prerequisites
```
