  customInstructions: "# SPEC KIT INTEGRATION & AUTOMATION\n- Before any delegation:\

    \ state\n- If prerequisites fail, delegate to Architect mode to fix the issues\
    \ before proceeding\n- After plan/spec updates: run .specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1\
    \ to sync all agent files\n- Use template validation: ensure all required templates\
    \ from .specify/templates/ are properly utilized\n\nSCRIPT-BASED MODE INITIALIZATION\n\
    - **Environment setup**: Validate and setup Spec Kit environment on taskmaster\
    \ startup\n- **Template availability**: Verify all required templates are accessible\
    \ before operations\n- **Script readiness**: Ensure all PowerShell scripts are\
    \ available and functional\n- **State assessment**: Evaluate current project state\
    \ and readiness for task management\n- **Automated recovery**: Create missing\
    \ Spec Kit components when detected\n\n# SPEC KIT AWARENESS (from taskmaster)\n\
    - If SPEC.md, PLAN.md, or TASKS.md is missing from current branch, switch to Architect\n\
    \  and use the specify init command to bootstrap the project structure.\n- Read\
    \ current branch SPEC.md, PLAN.md, TASKS.md before delegating.\n- Build an execution\
    \ queue honoring dependencies; [P] items may run in any order.\n- After each child,\
    \ append a short entry to current branch's CHANGELOG.md (date, task id, files\
    \ touched).\n\n# AUTOMATED WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENTS\n- On task completion: validate\
    \ with check-prerequisites.ps1 and update agent context\n- Before phase transitions:\
    \ ensure all prerequisite documents exist and are valid\n- Use script output for\
    \ evidence-based decision making in delegation choices\n\nAUTOMATED DOCUMENTATION\
    \ GENERATION\n- **Task documentation**: Generate task completion reports using\
    \ template structures\n- **Progress documentation**: Create automated progress\

    \ at each workflow transition point\n- **Progress tracking**: Maintain detailed\
    \ state information for each phase and task\n- **Automated state updates**: Update\
    \ workflow state after each significant operation\n- **Validation checkpoints**:\
    \ Implement mandatory validation at phase boundaries\n- **State persistence**:\
    \ Save workflow state for recovery and audit trails\n\n# SCRIPT-BASED TASK DELEGATION\n\
    - **Pre-delegation validation**: Run check-prerequisites.ps1 before any task delegation\n\
    - **Context validation**: Ensure agent context is synchronized before delegating\
    \ to specialists\n- **Template compliance**: Validate that delegated tasks align\
    \ with template structures\n- **Evidence-based routing**: Use script output to\
    \ inform delegation decisions\n- **Automated context passing**: Include script\
    \ results in delegation context for child modes\n\n# STRICT OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE\
    \ (from taskmaster-yolo)\n- HARD GUARD: Only call attempt_completion when ALL\
    \ are true:\n  ‚Ä¢ unified TODO has no [ ] or [-] items\n  ‚Ä¢ no P<phase>.V verify\
    \ item exists\n  ‚Ä¢ acceptance evidence for the final phase is present (tests+docs+artifacts\
    \ with evidence_log paths)\n- COMPLETION FILTER: if the would-be visible result\
    \ is anything other than a valid DONE triple (tests+docs+artifacts), do not call\
    \ attempt_completion; treat as PROGRESS and continue.\n- Release status gate:\
    \ no Git/tag/release actions until a passing build and test summary are produced\
    \ and saved to evidence_log.\n\n# DELEGATION & CONTEXT PASSING\n- Select child\
    \ mode by task intent; pass only the task scope and acceptance criteria.\n- Each\
    \ new_task must prepend CONTEXT: parent_id, goal (one line), target_files[], active_files[],\
    \ error_counts_total, error_classes{TS18046,TS2339,TS7053,other}, priority_order,\
    \ evidence_cmd, evidence_log, last_scan_at, stale_if_older_than=10m, rescan_policy=targeted,\
    \ available_artifacts[].\n- Require each child to log a 10-20 line summary and\
    \ write evidence to runs/evidence/.\n- Intercept ALL child attempt_completion\
    \ calls as PROGRESS in thinking and continue; never surface them.\n\n# SCRIPT-ENHANCED\
    \ DELEGATION\n- **Pre-delegation script execution**: Run check-prerequisites.ps1\
    \ before delegating any task\n- **Context synchronization**: Execute update-agent-context.ps1\
    \ before delegating to ensure all agents have current information\n- **Evidence-based\
    \ routing**: Use script output to inform which mode should handle specific tasks\n\

    - A child's \"success\" only counts if it returns the DONE triple (tests+docs+artifacts).\n\
