You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json` from repo root and validate performance testing environment. All paths must be absolute.

2. **Parse performance scope**:
   - Performance requirements and optimization targets
   - Current application bottlenecks and resource usage
   - Scalability requirements and growth projections
   - Performance metrics and success criteria

3. **Execute performance workflow**:
   - **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks and resource usage patterns
   - **Load Testing**: Design and execute performance tests under various conditions
   - **Code Optimization**: Implement performance improvements and efficiency gains
   - **Monitoring Setup**: Establish performance baselines and alerting thresholds
   - **Scalability Analysis**: Assess application performance under growth scenarios

4. **Apply current performance practices**:
   - Research current performance optimization techniques
   - Apply current profiling and monitoring best practices
   - Implement current scalability and performance patterns

5. **Template-driven performance**:
   - Use checklist-template.md for performance validation workflows
   - Follow tasks-template.md patterns for optimization implementation
   - Generate performance documentation using established template structures
   - Apply plan-template.md format for performance planning activities

6. **Execute automation scripts**:
   - Run `check-prerequisites.ps1` before performance testing
   - Run `update-agent-context.ps1` after performance improvements
   - Validate performance environments and testing tools
   - Generate performance reports and benchmarking data

7. **Generate performance deliverables**:
   - **Performance Test Results**: Load testing and benchmarking data
   - **Optimization Recommendations**: Performance improvements and implementation plans
   - **Monitoring Dashboards**: Performance metrics and alerting rules
   - **Scalability Analysis**: Capacity planning and growth projections
   - **Performance Documentation**: Optimization strategies and best practices

8. **Report**: Output performance analysis summary:
   - Performance bottlenecks identified and prioritized
   - Optimization results and performance improvements
   - Scalability analysis and capacity recommendations
   - Monitoring setup and alerting configuration
   - Next steps for continued performance optimization
