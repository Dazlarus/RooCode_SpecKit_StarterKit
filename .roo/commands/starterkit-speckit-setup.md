## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Set up a complete Spec Kit development environment with Roo Code integration by:
1. Installing or updating Spec Kit CLI
2. Initializing a new Spec Kit project
3. Guiding the user through team configuration selection
4. Importing the selected team configuration to .roomodes
5. Validating the complete setup

## Operating Constraints

**FULLY AUTOMATED**: Execute all installation, initialization, and configuration steps automatically without requiring user intervention for technical details.

**NON-DESTRUCTIVE**: Preserve any existing .roomodes configuration and merge new team modes without overwriting existing custom modes.

**USER-FRIENDLY**: Provide clear progress indicators, explanations, and troubleshooting guidance throughout the process.

**ROBUST ERROR HANDLING**: Gracefully handle installation failures, network issues, and configuration conflicts with clear recovery instructions.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Environment Assessment

Check current system state and gather requirements:

- Verify internet connectivity for downloading dependencies
- Check if uv package manager is available (install if missing)
- Determine if this is a fresh setup or existing project
- Parse any user input for project name or team preferences

### 2. Spec Kit Installation/Update

Execute the appropriate installation workflow:

**If Spec Kit not installed:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

**If Spec Kit already installed:**
```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

**Verification:**
```bash
specify --help
```

Abort with clear error message if installation fails, providing troubleshooting steps.

### 3. Project Initialization

Initialize the Spec Kit project structure in current directory:

```bash
# Initialization happens here
specify init .
```

**Context-Aware Project Setup:**
- Auto-detect project name from current folder name
- Scan existing files (README, package.json, setup.py) for project context
- Use LLM analysis to determine optimal project description and objectives
- Initialize in current directory (avoid creating subfolders)

Verify successful initialization by checking:
- .specify/ directory created in current location
- Basic project templates available
- Configuration files in place
- No subfolder created

### 4. Interactive Constitution Creation

Guide the user through creating the initial project constitution:

**Load Constitution Template:**
- Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand required placeholders
- Identify tokens like `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`, `[RATIFICATION_DATE]`, etc.

**Interactive Value Collection:**
- **Project Identity:** Ask for project name, description, and main objectives (auto-detect from folder name and existing files)
- **Core Principles:** Help user define fundamental development principles (auto-detect based on project context):
  - Quality Assurance (testing, validation, acceptance criteria)
  - Security (vulnerability management, secure coding practices)
  - Performance (optimization, monitoring, scalability requirements)
  - Documentation (README, API docs, inline comments)
  - Collaboration (code review, communication, knowledge sharing)

**Smart Context Detection:**
- Analyze current folder name and repository structure
- Scan existing files (README, package.json, setup.py, etc.) for project clues
- Infer project type, scale, and complexity from codebase patterns
- Auto-recommend team configuration based on detected project characteristics

**Constitution Structure:**
- Project overview and mission statement
- Non-negotiable MUST requirements for each principle
- SHOULD recommendations for best practices
- Governance procedures (amendment process, version management)
- Compliance and review expectations

**Template Integration:**
- Update plan-template.md with constitution references
- Update spec-template.md with principle alignment
- Update tasks-template.md with governance requirements
- Ensure all templates reflect the established principles

**Version Management:**
- Set initial version as 1.0.0
- Use today's date for ratification
- Create sync impact report documenting all changes

### 5. Interactive Team Selection

Present team configuration options and get user preference:

**Display Options:**
- **üê£ Beginner (7 modes)**: Architect, Ask, Code, Debug, Documentation Writer, Taskmaster, Verifier
- **üèóÔ∏è Foundation (10 modes)**: All Beginner modes + Issue Writer, Repository Cleanup, Project Research
