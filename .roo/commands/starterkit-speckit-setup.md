## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Set up a complete Spec Kit development environment with Roo Code integration by:
1. Installing or updating Spec Kit CLI
2. Initializing a new Spec Kit project
3. Guiding the user through team configuration selection
4. Importing the selected team configuration to .roomodes
5. Validating the complete setup

## Operating Constraints

**FULLY AUTOMATED**: Execute all installation, initialization, and configuration steps automatically without requiring user intervention for technical details.

**NON-DESTRUCTIVE**: Preserve any existing .roomodes configuration and merge new team modes without overwriting existing custom modes.

**USER-FRIENDLY**: Provide clear progress indicators, explanations, and troubleshooting guidance throughout the process.

**ROBUST ERROR HANDLING**: Gracefully handle installation failures, network issues, and configuration conflicts with clear recovery instructions.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Environment Assessment

Check current system state and gather requirements:

- Verify internet connectivity for downloading dependencies
- Check if uv package manager is available (install if missing)
- Determine if this is a fresh setup or existing project
- Parse any user input for project name or team preferences

### 2. Spec Kit Installation/Update

Execute the appropriate installation workflow:

**If Spec Kit not installed:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

**If Spec Kit already installed:**
```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

**Verification:**
```bash
specify --version
specify --help
```

Abort with clear error message if installation fails, providing troubleshooting steps.

### 3. Project Initialization

Initialize the Spec Kit project structure:

```bash
specify init "Complete project setup with Spec Kit and Roo Code integration"
```

Verify successful initialization by checking:
- .specify/ directory created
- Basic project templates available
- Configuration files in place

### 4. Interactive Constitution Creation

Guide the user through creating the initial project constitution:

**Load Constitution Template:**
- Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand required placeholders
- Identify tokens like `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`, `[RATIFICATION_DATE]`, etc.

**Interactive Value Collection:**
- **Project Identity:** Ask for project name, description, and main objectives
- **Core Principles:** Help user define fundamental development principles:
  - Quality Assurance (testing, validation, acceptance criteria)
  - Security (vulnerability management, secure coding practices)
  - Performance (optimization, monitoring, scalability requirements)
  - Documentation (README, API docs, inline comments)
  - Collaboration (code review, communication, knowledge sharing)

**Constitution Structure:**
- Project overview and mission statement
- Non-negotiable MUST requirements for each principle
- SHOULD recommendations for best practices
- Governance procedures (amendment process, version management)
- Compliance and review expectations

**Template Integration:**
- Update plan-template.md with constitution references
- Update spec-template.md with principle alignment
- Update tasks-template.md with governance requirements
- Ensure all templates reflect the established principles

**Version Management:**
- Set initial version as 1.0.0
- Use today's date for ratification
- Create sync impact report documenting all changes

### 5. Interactive Team Selection

Present team configuration options and get user preference:

**Display Options:**
- **üê£ Beginner (7 modes)**: Architect, Ask, Code, Debug, Documentation Writer, Taskmaster, Verifier
- **üèóÔ∏è Foundation (10 modes)**: All Beginner modes + Issue Writer, Repository Cleanup, Project Research
- **üöÄ Enterprise (17 modes)**: All Foundation modes + API Designer, DevOps Engineer, Jest Test Engineer, Performance Engineer, Release Manager, Research Updater, Security Reviewer

**Get Selection:**
Ask user: "Which team configuration best fits your project needs? (beginner/foundation/enterprise)"

**Default:** If no clear preference, recommend Foundation as the balanced middle ground.

### 5. Project Constitution Creation

Create the initial project constitution to establish governance principles:

**Load Constitution Template:**
- Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` template
- Identify all placeholder tokens in format `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`
- Parse existing project context for default values

**Interactive Constitution Setup:**
- **Project Identity:** Collect project name, description, and purpose
- **Core Principles:** Establish fundamental development principles (Quality, Security, Performance, Documentation, Testing)
- **Governance Rules:** Define decision-making processes and amendment procedures
- **Version Management:** Set initial constitution version (1.0.0) and ratification date

**Constitution Content Structure:**
- Project overview and objectives
- Non-negotiable development principles (MUST requirements)
- Recommended practices (SHOULD guidance)
- Amendment and governance procedures
- Version tracking and compliance requirements

**Template Synchronization:**
- Update `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` with constitution references
- Update `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` with principle alignment
- Update `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` with governance requirements
- Ensure all templates reflect constitution principles

**Generate Sync Impact Report:**
- Document version changes and rationale
- List all modified templates and files
- Create follow-up TODOs for manual adjustments
- Provide commit message suggestions

### 6. Team Configuration Import

Import the selected team configuration to .roomodes:

**Read existing configuration:**
- Load current .roomodes file (create if doesn't exist)
- Parse existing customModes array
- Preserve any existing configurations

**Convert and merge team configuration:**
- Read the selected team YAML file from Teams/ directory
- Convert YAML team configuration to JSON format
- Add all team modes to customModes array
- Maintain proper JSON structure and formatting

**Write updated configuration:**
- Save merged configuration back to .roomodes
- Validate JSON syntax and structure
- Ensure no data loss or corruption

### 7. Setup Validation

Verify complete setup functionality:

**Spec Kit Validation:**
```bash
specify status
specify validate
```

**Constitution Validation:**
- Verify `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists and is complete
- Check that no placeholder tokens remain unresolved
- Validate constitution version and dates
- Confirm template synchronization

**Configuration Validation:**
- Verify .roomodes file exists and contains valid JSON
- Confirm team modes are properly imported
- Check that mode count matches selection (7, 10, or 17 modes)

**Integration Testing:**
- Test that specify commands work correctly
- Verify project structure is complete
- Check for any permission or path issues

### 8. Completion and Guidance

Provide comprehensive setup summary and next steps:

**Success Confirmation:**
- Display which team configuration was installed
- Show number of modes imported
- Confirm Spec Kit functionality
- Verify constitution creation and template sync
